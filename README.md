# Basic Portfolio page
The third assignment of my coding bootcamp class has me finishing a random password generator.  The site is already complete, the generation function is the only thing that needed implementation.

# Description
The goal of this project is to implement a random password generator function to go with the provided website.  Again, the HTML and CSS were provided, as was the start of the JavaScript.
This challenge is meant to exercise my basic JavaScript skills with logic, operations, objects, and iteration.
